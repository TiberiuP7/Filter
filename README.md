### Using several filters, this program takes as input a photo in jpg format and the user chooses the action. It can choose between Grayscale, to make the photo black and white, Blur and Detect edges, which blurs the edges of the objects in the photo. As output, it generates the filtered photo.

I used different alghoritms for each filter to implement the functions.
